# HR_ATTRITION-DASHBOARD.

In this project, I created HR Attrition Dashboard using MS Excel.

Some Important insight were derived from the Dashboard such as:

1. Total Employees
2. Total Employee Attrition Rate
3. Total Active Employees
4. Total attrition by Employee Job Role
5. Total Attrition by Employee Education
6. Total Attrition by Employee Age Group & Gender
7. Total Attrition by High performance
8. Total Attrition by Low Performance
9. Total Attrtion by work Distance..

I used my DAX skill in creating calculated measures and skills
